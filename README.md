# US-Housing-Trends
Our gathering of the census data is broken up into each region. We used the list of apis listed in each regional notebook to
obtain the data columns we intended to review.

Per the description in the json_list all data listed in US dollars are inflation adjusted to the year 2022,
the last year of our review.

Each file collects the data for that region and outputs it as a csv file. They are broken up into the following regions.

Northeast (Malika)
Southeast (Chad)
Midwest (Will)
Southwest (Alice)
West (Jonathan)

The nationwide.pynb jupyter notebook file collects the outputs and merges them into one dataframe.
Our analysis of the data into graphs takes place in that file.

Our csv data files and list of api urls used are in the data folder.

Our jupyter notebook files are in the ipynb notebooks folder.

Our final conclusions are summarized in the CensusProjectConclusion.docx file.
